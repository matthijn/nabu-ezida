# nabu-ezida

**É.ZI.DA** — "House of Truth"

[Ezida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezida) was [Nabu's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabu) great temple in Borsippa, where scribes and scholars came to seek the god of writing. It was the place of encounter — where divine knowledge met human need.

This is Nabu's frontend. The temple where users come to interact with the system.

# nabu-shimtu

**Šimtu** — "Fate" / "What has been decreed"

In Mesopotamian thought, shimtu was destiny fixed by the gods — events sealed and unalterable once determined. The cosmic record of what has come to pass. The gods inscribed fate on the [Tablet of Destinies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_of_Destinies) (*ṭup šīmāti*), a permanent legal document that could not be revoked.

This is Nabu's core. Commands are issued, events are recorded, and what has happened becomes immutable truth.

# nabu-apkallu

**Apkallū** — "The Sages"

The [apkallu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apkallu) were seven legendary sages sent by the gods to bring wisdom to humanity before the flood. They emerged from the sea carrying divine knowledge, teaching mortals the arts of civilization.

This is Nabu's connection to external intelligence. The channel through which wisdom flows into the system.
