const INTERVIEW_DOC = `# Interview with participant P12

## Background

The participant has been working in healthcare for over fifteen years. She described her early career
as challenging but rewarding, noting that the organizational culture at her first hospital was
particularly supportive. She mentioned that mentorship programs were critical to her development.

## Key Findings

When asked about current challenges, she expressed significant concerns about staffing levels and
burnout among her colleagues. She felt that management was not adequately addressing the workload
issues, saying "we are constantly running on empty and nobody seems to care." She also highlighted
the lack of professional development opportunities compared to her earlier career.

## Technology Adoption

The participant was generally positive about new electronic health record systems but raised concerns
about the training process. She noted that older colleagues struggled significantly with the
transition and that the implementation timeline was unrealistic given the complexity of the system.`
